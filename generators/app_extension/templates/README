To finish writing your plugin, write just like you would for a normal application.

app/{controllers,helpers,models,views}
db/migrate/
test/*_test.rb (ok, not quite like a normal app)

public/* are copied into the main app public/<%= file_name %>/* directories.

Routes are defined in the init.rb file, but look very similar to config/routes.rb

View paths on controllers are set automatically to include the views in this directory, but you will need to manually specify 'template_root' in any mailers.

From your main app: rake <%= file_name %>:{migrate,test}
