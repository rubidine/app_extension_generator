Description:
    Will generate a plugin that can add routes and controllers/models/helpers
    into the main rails app.  Akin to engines and appable_plugins, but the
    results are self-contained.

Example:
    ./script/generate app_extension Thing

    This will create:
        vendor/plugins/thing/*
