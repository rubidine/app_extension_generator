AppExtensionGenerator
====================

Generate plugins that add models/controllers/migrations/tests/assets into an
existing application.

Unlike engines / appable plugins / &c., these plugins don't require on any other
plugins, not even AppExtensionGenerator.

usage
ruby script/generate app_extension my_extension

Then look in the README and init.rb in your new extension.
